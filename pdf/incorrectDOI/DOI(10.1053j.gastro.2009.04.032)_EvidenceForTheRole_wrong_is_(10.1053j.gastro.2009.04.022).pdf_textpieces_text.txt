83	Disease: Depression as Cause and Effect?

88	at large. 1 Past reviews of IBD and co-occurring psychiat-
89	ric disorders challenged the long-held belief that IBD was
90	primarily a psychosomatic illness, concluding that there was
91	little support for the role of psychological factors in the
92	development of ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease. 1,2
93	In a recent study using the Manitoba IBD Cohort it
94	was shown that patients with IBD compared with a
95	matched control group were significantly more likely to
96	have a lifetime diagnosis of major depression (27.2% vs
97	A s is the case with most chronic illnesses, there is a

102	[DNBS]), Ghia et al 14 explored the impact of depression
103	on the reactivation of quiescent colitis and underlying
104	mechanisms in mice. Induction of depression triggered
105	by 2 independent mechanisms including bulbectomy (to
106	induce maladaptive behavioral patterns similar to the
107	symptoms of patients with depression), 15 resulted in co-
108	litis reactivation. Conversely, desmethylimipramine that
109	improved the depression also dampened the colitis. An
110	important control experiment was the demonstration that
111	the tricyclic antidepressant treatment that inhibited depres-
112	sion-induced reactivation of colitis, did not influence gut
113	inflammation in the absence of depression. These studies
114	provide novel experimental evidence of a causal relationship
115	between depression and reactivation of colitis and the rele-
116	vance of antidepressants in stabilizing the impact of depres-
117	sion on quiescent gut inflammation.
118	12.3%; odds ratio [OR], 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI],
119	1.64 –2.95). 3 The strength of this study and what distin-
120	guished it from other past assessments of depression in
121	IBD was that it used population-based samples of patients
122	with IBD as well as of age-, gender-, and region-matched
123	community controls. It also used a gold standard tool for
124	measuring depression, namely, the Comprehensive Inter-
125	national Diagnostic Interview, a structured psychiatric
126	interview. Panic disorder tended to be higher among IBD
127	patients, but agoraphobia without panic was not signif-
128	icantly different between groups and social anxiety actu-
129	ally was significantly lower in the IBD group (6% vs 11%;
130	OR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.32– 0.85). In this study, those with
131	depression versus those without a history of depression
132	had earlier age of onset of their IBD symptoms and
133	earlier age at diagnosis of their IBD. For those with a
134	mood disorder, more than half of mood disorder diag-
135	noses antedated the diagnosis of IBD by 2 years and so
136	depression antedating IBD could not be explained simply
137	by IBD symptoms predisposing to depression. Even if
138	mood disorders are in remission before the onset of IBD,
139	it has been shown that lifetime experience with anxiety or
140	mood disorders can be important, even if not active
141	recently. Previous experience with a mental disorder has
142	been shown to increase the likelihood of a relapse in
143	chronic conditions, particularly during periods of stress. 4
144	Cumulatively, these data raise the issue as to whether
145	having depression predisposes to IBD, perhaps by en-
146	hancing the intestinal immunoinflammatory response.
147	Evidence has emerged about potential common path-
148	ways, particularly between depression and inflammatory
149	conditions such as IBD, related to dysfunctioning immu-
150	noregulatory circuits. 5–7 Alternatively, perhaps there is a
151	common genetic predisposition shared by both diseases,
152	or perhaps both diseases are triggered by similar environ-
153	mental factors with variable lead times to overt presen-
154	tation.
155	In their study, the authors also pursued mechanistic
156	investigations based on their previous work indicating
157	that depressive-like behaviors increased the severity of
158	acute DSS and DNBS colitis in mice by interfering with
159	the counterinflammatory action of the vagus nerve ex-
160	erted by nicotine receptors on gut macrophages. 16 They
161	also previously reported that tricyclic antidepressants act
162	by restoring parasympathetic anti-inflammatory func-
163	tion. 16 Using pharmacologic and operative approaches
164	along with genetically modified mice, in the current
165	study Ghia et al 14 similarly implicated impairment of the
166	vagal cholinergic pathway regulating cytokine secretion
167	in depression-induced reactivation of dormant colonic
168	inflammation. Desmethylimipramine treatment normal-
169	ized these changes. 14 In addition, they identified a critical
170	role of the -7 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine
171	receptor in inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine release
172	from gut macrophages. 14 These studies expand the grow-
173	ing evidence for the “cholinergic anti-inflammatory path-
174	way” coined by Tracey and the involvement of -7 sub-
175	unit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. 17,18 Of
176	interest was the demonstration that the colonic barrier
177	function was not altered as monitored 5 days after reac-
178	tivation of colitis in depressed mice regardless of treat-
179	ment with desmethylimipramine. However, additional
180	time points would be required to strengthen the conclu-
181	sion that “the reactivation seen here is not due to the
182	changes in intestinal barrier function.”
183	It is less surprising that there might be a higher rate
184	of depression concurrent with or after the diagnosis of
185	IBD. 8 –10 Could having depression adversely impact on the
186	course of the bowel disease? One study of IBD patients
187	enrolled after a flare found that those with clinically signif-
188	icant depressive symptoms at baseline were more likely to
189	relapse sooner. 11 In a prospective study of patients with
190	Crohn’s disease, major depression was a risk factor for
191	failure to achieve remission with infliximab treatment. 12
192	Depression is associated with lower adherence to treatment
193	regimens, which may also impact on disease course. 13
194	Gastroenterologists are generally ill equipped to treat
195	depression and perhaps even to diagnose it in its mild
196	form. Inquiry into mood disorders by gastroenterologists
197	might be limited by time constraints, reported as the
198	main barrier to inquiring of patients with irritable bowel
199	syndrome about sexual abuse. 19 Alternatively, they may
200	simply feel they lack the experience to deal with a newly
201	uncovered mental illness. It might just be time for gas-
202	troenterologists to become equipped with brief surveys
203	that can screen for depression. 20,21 It would help to have

233	therapies commonly used in depression have found some
234	success in managing irritable bowel syndrome. 23 Could
235	these therapies become important adjuncts in IBD treat-
236	ment? Based on both human and animal model data, it
237	seems warranted to consider clinical trials of antidepres-
238	sant therapy in IBD both for those who are depressed but
239	possibly also in those without depression. A review of the
240	literature of antidepressant therapy in IBD underscored
241	how limited the data are in this area. 24 Even if antide-
242	pressant therapy does not impact on intestinal inflam-
243	mation, it may impact on quality of life. 25 In view of the

248	vance in assessing whether antidepressants can improve

361	T he process of stellate cell trans-differentiation into
362	loproteinases levels and progressive degradation of the
363	fibrotic matrix. 3–6 Along these lines, regression of liver
364	fibrosis and, possibly, cirrhosis has been reported in pa-
365	tients with CLD, 7–9 once achieved with cessation of the
366	causative agent. Although the possibility for regression of
367	complete cirrhosis is unlikely, 10 specific induction of ap-
368	optosis in HSC may represent a realistic objective for
369	cell-targeted therapy of liver fibrosis at almost any stage
370	of the disease. From this perspective, it is important to
371	stress that human HSC are characterized by a much
372	higher resistance to apoptosis when compared to rodent
373	HSC and that anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 are
374	highly expressed in fibrogenic cells within human liver
375	tissue undergoing active fibrogenesis. 11 This indicates
376	that meaningful indications for therapy of human CLD
377	will be attained only when addressing this issue in hu-
378	man cell models and possibly, in therapeutic clinical
379	trials.
380	Based on this background, the identification of factors
381	and pathways promoting HSC survival seems to be cen-
382	tral, because it may provide the basis for pharmacologic
383	treatments able to induce HSC apoptosis. Candidate sur-
384	vival factors for HSC include transforming growth factor
385	myofibroblast-like cells, a key event in hepatic and
386	pancreatic fibrogenesis, is associated with the activation
387	of pathways promoting cell survival. 1 This phenomenon
388	has been described also in other cell types that participate
389	in the wound healing response in different organs and,
390	together with the remarkable increase in cell prolifera-
391	tion, leads to hyperplasia of extracellular matrix (ECM)-
392	producing cells, which represent a key factor in chronic
393	wound healing and tissue fibrogenesis. Considering the
394	natural history of chronic liver diseases (CLD), and par-
395	ticularly chronic hepatitis C, 2 it is possible that the ac-
396	celeration in the rate of fibrosis progression observed in
397	the late phases of the disease occurs when a critical mass
398	of profibrogenic cells is reached and is accompanied by a
399	progressive exhaustion of the molecular mechanisms reg-
400	ulating ECM degradation and remodelling. According to
401	current knowledge, it has been speculated that any fea-
402	sible treatment able to reduce ECM-producing cell hy-
403	perplasia would lead to a reduced rate of fibrosis progres-
404	sion or even to fibrosis regression when associated with a
405	treatment favoring the cessation of tissue damage. In this
406	context, it is likely that hepatic stellate cell (HSC) apo-
407	ptosis represents a major mechanism. Accordingly, data
408	from animal models indicate that recovery from acute or
409	chronic injury is characterized by apoptosis of HSC and,
410	as a consequence, reduction of tissue inhibitor of metal-
411	1, insulin-like growth factor-1, tissue inhibitor of met-
412	alloproteinase-1, and type I collagen 3,12,13 together with
413	persistent activation of nuclear factor- B (NF- B). Acti-
414	vation of NF- B is a key event in the activation of HSC in
415	cell culture models 14,15 and is accompanied by a sus-
416	tained transcriptional repression of IB , the inhibitor of
417	NF- B. 16 NF- B regulates a number of genes acting as
418	potent inhibitors of the cellular apoptotic machinery and
419	its activation promotes survival of HSC in the presence of
420	apoptotic stimuli. 15,17 IB is further inactivated by sev-
421	eral agents, including tumor necrosis factor- and lipo-
