22	advantage of not requiring structure is that a larger number of
23	substitutions can be predicted on. Of the non-synonymous
24	SNPs identified by the SNP Consortium, 74% were sufficiently
25	similar to homologs in protein sequence databases for SIFT
26	prediction. The number of substitutions that SIFT can predict
27	on is expected to increase as more genomes are sequenced and
28	more protein sequences become available.

37	Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) studies and
38	random mutagenesis projects identify amino acid
39	substitutions in protein-coding regions. Each sub-
40	stitution has the potential to affect protein function.
41	SIFT (Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant) is a program
42	that predicts whether an amino acid substitution
43	affects protein function so that users can prioritize
44	substitutions for further study. We have shown that
45	SIFT can distinguish between functionally neutral
46	and deleterious amino acid changes in mutagenesis
47	studies and on human polymorphisms. SIFT is
48	available at http://blocks.fhcrc.org/sift/SIFT.html.

78	SIFT presumes that important amino acids will be conserved
79	in the protein family, and so changes at well-conserved
80	positions tend to be predicted as deleterious. For example, if a
81	position in an alignment of a protein family only contains the
82	amino acid isoleucine, it is presumed that substitution to any
83	other amino acid is selected against and that isoleucine is
84	necessary for protein function. Therefore, a change to any
85	other amino acid will be predicted to be deleterious to protein
86	function. If a position in an alignment contains the
87	hydrophobic amino acids isoleucine, valine and leucine, then
88	SIFT assumes, in effect, that this position can only contain
89	amino acids with hydrophobic character. At this position,
90	changes to other hydrophobic amino acids are usually
91	predicted to be tolerated but changes to other residues (such
92	as charged or polar) will be predicted to affect protein
93	function.

97	Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are used as markers
98	in linkage and association studies to detect which regions in
99	the human genome may be involved in disease. SNPs in
100	coding and regulatory regions may be implicated in disease
101	themselves. Non-synonymous SNPs that lead to an amino acid
102	change in the protein product are of major interest, because
103	amino acid substitutions currently account for approximately
104	half of the known gene lesions responsible for human inherited
105	disease (1). SIFT (Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant) uses
106	sequence homology to predict whether an amino acid
107	substitution will affect protein function and hence, potentially
108	alter phenotype (2,3).

131	To predict whether an amino acid substitution in a protein
132	will affect protein function, SIFT considers the position at
133	which the change occurred and the type of amino acid
134	change. Given a protein sequence, SIFT chooses related
135	proteins and obtains an alignment of these proteins with the
136	query. Based on the amino acids appearing at each position
137	in the alignment, SIFT calculates the probability that an
138	amino acid at a position is tolerated conditional on the most
139	frequent amino acid being tolerated. If this normalized value
140	is less than a cutoff, the substitution is predicted to be
141	deleterious (2). The SIFT algorithm and software have been
142	described previously (2,3).

150	SIFT has been applied to human variant databases and was
151	able to distinguish mutations involved in disease from neutral
152	polymorphisms (3). Assuming that disease-causing amino acid
153	substitutions are damaging to protein function, we applied SIFT
154	to a database of missense substitutions associated with or
155	involved in disease (4). SIFT predicted 69% to be damaging.
156	When SIFT was applied to the non-synonymous SNPs in
157	dbSNP (5), a database of putative SNPs, 25% of the variants
158	were predicted to be deleterious. This was similar to SIFT’s
159	20% false positive error which suggested that most non-
160	synonymous SNPs are functionally neutral. Furthermore, a
161	subset of the variants from dbSNP predicted to affect function
162	were involved in disease which confirmed SIFT sensitivity.

210	Confidence in a substitution predicted to be deleterious
211	depends on the diversity of the sequences in the alignment. If
212	the sequences used for prediction are closely related, then
213	many positions will appear conserved and SIFT will predict
214	most substitutions to affect protein function. This leads to a
215	high false positive error where functionally neutral substitu-
216	tions are predicted to be deleterious.
217	For minimal involvement, users can simply submit their
218	protein sequences and amino acid substitutions. In its fully
219	automated mode, SIFT will search for protein sequences
220	homologous to the query protein and based on these
221	sequences, calculate probabilities for each possible amino acid
222	change. Users can select from among SWISS-PROT, SWISS-
223	PROT/TrEMBL, or NCBI’s non-redundant protein databases
224	for SIFT to search (4,9).

247	To alert the user to these situations, SIFT calculates the
248	median conservation value which measures the diversity of the
249	sequences in the alignment. Conservation, as measured by
250	information content (11), is calculated for each position in the
251	alignment and the median of these values is obtained.
252	Conservation ranges from log 2 20 ( ¼ 4.32), when a position
253	is completely conserved and only one amino acid is observed,
254	to zero, when all 20 amino acids are observed at a position. By
255	default, SIFT builds alignments with a median conservation
256	value of 3.0. Predictions based on sequence alignments with
257	higher median conservation values are less diverse and will
258	have a higher false positive error (Fig. 2).
259	Although SIFT can choose sequences automatically, better
260	prediction results may be obtained when all of the sequences
261	that are provided are orthologous to the query protein. This is
262	because inclusion of paralogous sequences confounds predic-
263	tion at residues conserved only among the orthologues. If a
264	user already has sequences that are thought to be functionally
265	similar to the protein of interest, these sequences can be
266	directly submitted and SIFT’s step for choosing sequences
267	skipped. Given the query protein and homologous sequences,
268	SIFT obtains the alignment.

287	If regions are misaligned, SIFT will not recognize conserved

303	Even if there are few homologous sequences available, SIFT
304	performs better than simply predicting non-conservative amino
305	acid substitutions as deleterious, where non-conservative
306	changes are defined as having negative scores in an amino
307	acid substitution scoring matrix. We have shown that with only
308	one sequence homologous to the test protein, SIFT can predict
309	twice as many neutral substitutions correctly compared to a
310	substitution scoring matrix (2). Even with few homologous
311	sequences, there will be positions that differ between the test
312	protein and the other sequences. Depending on the amino acids
313	appearing at these positions, SIFT may predict these positions
314	to be unimportant for protein function. This additional
315	information can eliminate functionally neutral substitutions
316	and increase selectivity to deleterious substitutions.
317	Predictions are given for all 20 possible amino acid changes at
318	each position in the protein. The alignment is also returned so
319	that users can examine the sequences used for prediction and
320	modify them for resubmission. This option is also useful for
321	removing uncertain, erroneous and misaligned sequences from
322	alignment output generated by SIFT in its automatic mode.
323	For amino acid substitutions submitted by the user, a more
324	detailed synopsis is provided (Fig. 1). The score is the
325	normalized probability that the amino acid change is tolerated.
326	SIFT predicts substitutions with scores less than 0.05 as
327	deleterious. Some SIFT users have found that substitutions
328	with scores less than 0.1 provide better sensitivity for detecting
329	deleterious SNPs (Cornelia Ulrich, personal communication
330	In summary, a large number of substitutions can be obtained
331	from mutagenesis projects, SNP datasets, and changes between
332	closely related organisms. When it is not feasible to conduct
333	experiments on all substitutions, SIFT and other similar
334	prediction tools (13) may be useful in prioritizing which

376	Figure 2. Prediction depends on the diversity of the sequences used in the alignment. Percentage of substitutions correctly predicted is based on over 4000 sub-
377	stitutions that were assayed throughout the LacI protein of Escherichia coli (2,12). When the sequences in the alignment used for prediction are closely related (high
378	median conservation) then many positions appear conserved and important for function. In this situation, prediction accuracy on deleterious substitutions is high but
379	many functionally neutral substitutions are erroneously predicted to be deleterious. To obtain an alignment with a specified median conservation, the LacI protein
380	sequence of E.coli was submitted to the SIFT website and the median conservation setting adjusted. Because the homologous sequences available are distantly
381	related to E.coli LacI, alignments with higher median conservation values could not be obtained. In order to obtain alignments with median conservation values
382	more than 3.25, closely related sequences were simulated by starting with an alignment of identical E.coli LacI sequences. A position and a sequence were randomly
383	selected from the LacI alignment with median conservation 2.75. The amino acid corresponding to this location was substituted in the starting alignment. Amino
384	acids continued to be randomly selected and substituted until the desired median conservation was met. The simulated alignment was then evaluated for its per-
385	formance as previously described (2) and the plotted value is the average performance of 100 simulated alignments.
