21	Nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) are
22	coding variants that introduce amino acid changes in their corre-
23	sponding proteins. Because nsSNPs can affect protein function, they
24	are believed to have the largest impact on human health compared
25	with SNPs in other regions of the genome. Therefore, it is impor-
26	tant to distinguish those nsSNPs that affect protein function from
27	those that are functionally neutral. Here we provide an overview of
28	amino acid substitution (AAS) prediction methods, which use se-
29	quence and/or structure to predict the effect of an AAS on protein
30	function. Most methods predict approximately 25–30% of human
31	nsSNPs to negatively affect protein function, and such nsSNPs tend
32	to be rare in the population. We discuss the utility of AAS prediction
33	methods for Mendelian and complex diseases as well as their broader
34	applications for understanding protein function.

37	INTRODUCTION

42	discovered in
43	patients and found in
44	genes known to be
45	involved in disease
46	pared with positions that are not conserved,
47	suggested that prediction could be based on
48	sequence homology (39). It was also observed
49	that disease-causing AASs had common struc-
50	tural features that distinguished them from
51	neutral substitutions, suggesting that struc-
52	ture could also be used for prediction (68,
53	77). Since these studies were performed, a
54	plethora of AAS prediction methods based
55	on sequence and/or structure have become
56	available (7, 9, 14, 16–19, 27, 31, 33, 40–
57	42, 45–47, 53, 58, 59, 64, 65, 68, 69, 72,
58	73).
59	Human Gene
60	Mutation Database
61	Most genetic variation is considered neutral
62	but single base changes in and around a gene
63	can affect its expression or the function of its
64	protein products (11, 56). A nonsynonymous
65	or missense variant is a single base change
66	in a coding region that causes an amino acid
67	change in the corresponding protein. If a non-
68	synonymous variant alters protein function,
69	the change can have drastic phenotypic conse-
70	quences. Most alterations are deleterious and
71	so are eventually eliminated through purify-
72	ing selection. However, beneﬁcial mutations
73	can sweep through the population and be-
74	come ﬁxed, thus contributing to species dif-
75	ferentiation.

90	In this review we ﬁrst survey existing AAS
91	prediction methods and summarize the his-
92	tory of the ﬁeld. We also offer practical advice
93	for researchers who would like to use AAS pre-
94	diction methods. Next, we look at the useful-
95	ness of AAS prediction methods in identify-
96	ing candidate mutations responsible for both
97	Mendelian and complex diseases. Third, we
98	discuss other applications of AAS prediction
99	methods. Finally, we discuss likely future im-
100	provements of such methods.

104	The importance of nonsynonymous sub-
105	stitutions in humans is illustrated by two
106	databases containing disease-causing vari-
107	ants, Online Mendelian Inheritance in
108	Man (OMIM) and Human Gene Muta-
109	tion Database (HGMD) (24, 62). In both
110	databases, nonsynonymous changes account
111	for approximately half of the genetic changes
112	known to cause disease. Although these
113	databases contain information primarily con-
114	cerning disorders caused by single Mendelian
115	lesions, it is likely that nonsynonymous
116	changes will play a similarly important role in
117	complex diseases because of their potentially
118	large impact.

127	Basic Methodology
128	The human population is estimated to
129	have 67,000–200,000 common nonsynony-
130	mous SNPs (nsSNPs) (8, 23, 35) and each
131	person is thought to be heterozygous for
132	24,000–40,000 nsSNPs (8). It would be time-
133	consuming, difﬁcult, and expensive to ex-
134	perimentally characterize the impact of each
135	nsSNP on protein function. But because an
136	amino acid change can have a large impact
137	on ﬁtness, a computational method that could
138	predict whether an amino acid substitution
139	(AAS) affects protein function would help re-
140	searchers prioritize AASs for additional study.
141	The observation that disease-causing muta-
142	tions are more likely to occur at positions that
143	are conserved throughout evolution, as com-
144	AAS prediction methods use sequence
145	and/or structural information for prediction.
146	Prediction is feasible because mutations
147	that affect protein function tend to occur at
148	evolutionarily conserved sites (Figure 1a)
149	and/or are buried in protein structure
150	(Figure 1b). These observations came from
151	several early studies that used AASs found
152	in disease genes in affected individuals (39,
153	68, 77). These studies assumed that these
154	substitutions affected protein function,
155	thereby causing disease. These studies also
156	assumed that a majority of nsSNPs in hu-
157	mans or the substitutions observed between
158	humans and closely related species are
159	functionally neutral. When Wang & Moult
160	(77) modeled disease-causing mutations

198	onto their corresponding wild-type protein
199	structures, they found that 83% of disease-
200	causing mutations affected protein stability.
201	By applying the stability criterion and
202	several other structural criteria, they could
203	detect 90% of disease-causing mutations. In
204	contrast, only 30% of neutral nsSNPs were
205	detected with the same set of rules, which
206	suggests that their rules could be used to
207	distinguish disease-causing mutations from
208	neutral nsSNPs. Using both structure and
209	sequence, Sunyaev et al. (68) could detect
210	70% of disease-causing mutations and only
211	17% of neutral substitutions. Based on anal-
212	ysis of protein sequences, Miller & Kumar
213	(39) showed that disease-causing AASs are
214	overabundant at conserved sites.

272	33, 40–42, 45–47, 53, 58, 59, 64, 65, 68, 69,
273	72, 73). The typical procedure used by AAS
274	prediction methods is shown in Figure 2. To
275	make a prediction, AAS prediction methods
276	can use sequence, structure, and/or annota-
277	tion. Sequence-based AAS prediction meth-
278	ods (14, 18, 19, 42, 45, 58, 69, 73) accept
279	an input sequence and search it against a
280	sequence database to ﬁnd homologous se-
281	quences. A multiple sequence alignment of
282	the homologous sequences reveals what posi-
283	tions have been conserved throughout evolu-
284	tionary time, and these positions are inferred
285	to be important for function. The AAS pre-
286	diction method then scores the AAS based
287	on the amino acids appearing in the multi-
288	ple alignment and the severity of the amino
289	acid change. An amino acid that is not present
290	at the substitution site in the multiple align-
291	ment can still be predicted to be tolerated
292	if there are amino acids with similar physio-
293	chemical properties present in the alignment.

297	Nonsynonymous SNPs found in normal individuals are assumed to be
298	benign and their probabilities show the opposite trend where their
299	occurrence decreases with the degree of site conservation. The benign
300	synonymous SNPs do not change amino acids and should be predominantly
301	neutral. As a result, their probability is uniform across sites, regardless of
302	whether or not the site is conserved. Figure from Reference 75; licensee

452	percentage of substitutions predicted to be damaging on substitutions known to be functionally neutral. For some methods, error rates were not
453	reported and are marked as N/A in the table. The coverage shown in this table is for dbSNP (60) and not for mutations in disease genes. Disease
454	genes tend to have higher coverage because they are well studied. Coverage depends on databases, so methods published later tend to have more

526	into account several structure factors such
527	as solvent accessibility, carbon-beta density,
528	crystallographic B-factor, and the difference
529	in free energy between the new and the old

534	(9, 27, 65, 69, 72) take an input sequence and
535	ﬁnd the best match against a protein structure

537	prediction methods use general structural fea-
538	tures surrounding the site of substitution and
539	do not require detailed information at the
540	AAS prediction methods can also incor-
541	porate annotations to reﬁne prediction. The

547	mutations found in disease genes, it is as-
548	sumed that the AAS found in the patient is
549	the causative variant. However, the database
550	entry is not necessarily the etiological variant.
551	Instead, it could be in linkage disequilibrium
552	with the causative variant. Alternatively, the
553	causative mutation could be in an unscreened
554	gene.
555	are involved in ligand binding, are part of
556	a disulﬁde bridge, or are involved in other
557	protein-protein interactions (1). AAS predic-
558	tion methods can use this information to guide
559	prediction (17, 18, 68, 69, 77). For example,
560	if the position of the AAS is annotated as
561	involved in ligand binding, then the AAS is
562	predicted to affect the protein. Also, one can
563	use sequence-based predictions of secondary
564	structure and solvent accessibility and incor-
565	porate this annotation into the scoring scheme
566	(18, 31).
567	Popular neutral sets include substitutions
568	that cause no phenotypic effect in mutagenesis
569	experiments (36, 49, 54, 80) and nonsynony-
570	mous single-nucleotide mutations that have
571	been ﬁxed during divergence between human
572	and a closely related species. The false posi-
573	tive error rate based on the ﬁrst set tends to be
574	higher than the second set because mutations
575	deemed neutral in laboratory experiments are
576	those that do not give a detectable pheno-
577	type. However, such mutations could have too
578	small an impact on protein function or re-
579	quire alternative environmental conditions to
580	reveal phenotypic effects (46). In the second
581	set, substitutions between human and another

583	evolutionary selective pressure, whereas those
584	with negligible selection coefﬁcients and very
585	small effects on protein function have been
586	eliminated.
587	Direct comparisons between AAS predic-
588	tion methods are difﬁcult because they were
589	trained and tested on different data sets using
590	different versions of sequence and structural
591	databases as resources. The performance of an
592	AAS prediction method depends on the data
593	sets the method is tested on. AAS prediction
594	methods are typically tested on two types of
595	data sets: a nonneutral set, which contains sub-
596	stitutions assumed to affect protein function,
597	and a neutral set, which contains substitutions
598	assumed to have no effect. An AAS prediction
599	method should predict the substitutions in
600	the nonneutral set to be damaging to protein
601	function. The percentage of non-neutral sub-
602	stitutions incorrectly predicted to be tolerated
603	is an approximation of the false negative er-
604	ror rate. The AAS prediction method should
605	also predict the majority of the substitutions
606	in a neutral set as having no effect on protein
607	function. The percentage of neutral substitu-
608	tions incorrectly predicted to affect protein
609	function approximates the false positive error
610	rate. The best AAS prediction methods mini-
611	mize both false negative and false positive er-
612	ror rates.
613	There are many AAS prediction meth-
614	ods available and it is beyond the scope of
615	this review to critique and compare every
616	method. We have tried to summarize the ma-
617	jor points of each method (Supplemental
618	Table 1). It is encouraging that progress is
619	being made in that overall prediction per-
620	formance has improved over early meth-
621	ods, and many methods are now available
622	to the research community as Web servers
623	(Table 1).
624	Caveats for Using Structure in
625	Prediction
626	Popular nonneutral sets include data from
627	laboratory mutagenesis experiments (36, 49,
628	54, 80), human disease proteins where many
629	mutations have been characterized (3, 21,
630	22, 25, 32, 50, 55, 70), and human disease
631	databases such as OMIM, HGMD, or Swiss-
632	Prot (1, 24, 62), which contain AASs that have
633	been found in patients. Currently, the muta-
634	genesis data sets represent only a few pro-
635	teins, so caution should be used in extrapo-
636	AAS methods that use only protein struc-
637	ture provide fewer predictions than meth-
638	ods that use sequence because there are far
639	fewer protein structures than sequences for

656	age of amino acid substitutions that can be
657	predicted by an AAS method is deﬁned as the
658	method’s coverage. Coverage for AAS meth-
659	ods that rely on protein structure only is ap-
660	proximately 14% (83), whereas coverage for
661	AAS methods that use sequence can be as
662	high as 81% (53). Notably, most methods
663	now have a sequence-based score and anal-
664	ysis of structure has become an option of-
665	fered by the methods. Sequence-based cov-
666	erage should continue to improve, because
667	large-scale sequencing projects are deposit-
668	ing predicted protein sequences into public
669	databases at an increasing rate, whereas de-
670	termination of three-dimensional (3D) struc-
671	tures remains a challenging endeavor.

675	Some AAS methods use structural and
676	functional annotation from the Swiss-Prot
677	database in addition to structure and sequence
678	modeling (17, 18, 68, 69, 77). The functional
679	annotation is used to identify the residues that
680	are part of a binding site, active site, or disul-
681	ﬁde bond. It is presumed that changes at these
682	types of sites would have major effects on
683	protein function. Hence, substitutions occur-
684	ring at these positions are predicted to affect
685	function. One would think that use of such
686	annotation would improve prediction, but a
687	recent study shows that use of Swiss-Prot
688	functional annotation decreases the overall
689	prediction accuracy (83). Although use of
690	Swiss-Prot annotation reduces the false neg-
691	ative rate by 1.6%, it increases the false posi-
692	tive rate by 2.1%. Therefore, caution is war-
693	ranted when interpreting results, based solely
694	on functional annotation, in which an AAS is
695	predicted to be damaging.

707	When the structure of the query pro-
708	tein is not available, AAS prediction meth-
709	ods model the query protein’s structure based
710	on a homolog. If the homolog is too distantly
711	related, prediction accuracy can suffer. Chas-
712	man & Adams (9) obtained their best predic-
713	tion results when the query protein was at least
714	60% identical to its homolog. Yue & Moult
715	(82) found that prediction is best when the
716	sequence identity between the query protein
717	and the homologous protein is greater than
718	40%. The false positive rate for their AAS
719	prediction method increased by 11% when
720	structures with less than 40% sequence iden-
721	tity were used (82).
722	Even when a structure is available, predic-
723	tion based solely on protein structure can be
724	misleading because the protein’s structure is
725	often determined in the isolated context of
726	a crystal and cannot take into consideration
727	supramolecular interactions. Structure-based
728	AAS prediction methods tend to predict
729	positions on the surface of the protein as
730	neutral. Although substitutions at sites buried
731	in protein structure are more likely to be
732	damaging than surface residues, substitutions
733	at sites that appear to be solvent-accessible in
734	the crystal structure may also be important
735	for function. These sites might be involved
736	in intermolecular interactions with proteins
737	that are absent from the 3D structure of the
738	single protein. For example, the β-globin
739	E6V substitution causes sickle-cell anemia.
740	The substitution occurs on the surface of the
741	protein and leads to formation of hemoglobin
742	aggregates that underlie the sickling phe-
743	notype. E6V is incorrectly predicted to be
744	benign by a structure-/sequence-based AAS
745	prediction method, Polymorphism Pheno-
746	typing (PolyPhen) (71), whereas it is correctly
747	predicted by a sequence homology-based
748	AAS prediction method, Sorting Intolerant
749	From Tolerant (SIFT). One possible way
750	to compensate for such misprediction is to
751	identify surface pockets or depressed regions
752	in the protein’s structure, which can be
753	Caveats for Using Sequence
754	in Prediction
755	The ﬁrst step for all sequence-based AAS
756	prediction methods is to choose homologous
757	sequences, whether manually or automati-
758	cally. Because the amino acids appearing in
759	the aligned sequences form the basis of the

762	functions, then the positions that differentiate
763	function among orthologs may be incorrectly
764	predicted.
765	Figure 3
766	Although functional differences between
767	orthologs can result in misprediction by AAS
768	methods, prior knowledge that orthologs have
769	different functions can be used to identify
770	which amino acid(s) caused the functional
771	change. For example, AlcR is a transcrip-
772	tional regulator whose activation depends on
773	the presence of an inducer in one Bordetella
774	species but not in another species (5). Al-
775	though the AlcR genes are clearly orthologs
776	in the genus, they behave differently in dif-
777	ferent species. To ﬁnd the amino acid change
778	underlying this behavioral difference, the au-
779	thors of this study used the AAS prediction
780	method, SIFT, which predicted that a seem-
781	ingly conservative change (S103T) should not
782	be tolerated. The authors deduced that this
783	residue was likely responsible for inducer de-
784	pendence, which they subsequently proved
785	by showing that S103T eliminated inducer
786	dependence.
787	For some amino acid substitution (AAS) prediction methods, researchers
788	can submit a multiple sequence alignment for their protein of interest;
789	using orthologs in the multiple sequence alignment instead of paralogs
790	gives better performance. Blue points represent prediction accuracy based
791	on an alignment of the input protein and ﬁve sequences randomly chosen
792	from a group of orthologs and paralogs. The red point is the prediction
793	accuracy based on a multiple sequence alignment of the input protein
794	sequence and ﬁve orthologs. Figure from Reference 67. Published with

797	scoring and the prediction, the sequences and
798	their alignment are extremely important, and
799	users can take an active role in this prediction
800	step, which determines the quality of their
801	predictions. The optimal set of sequences is
802	distantly related orthologs. Using orthologs
803	instead of paralogs can improve performance
804	by 8%, even when there are few sequences
805	(67) (Figure 3).
806	Most AAS prediction methods do not take
807	DNA sequence into account. As a result,
808	they can miss changes that alter splice sites
809	or changes in regions under positive selec-
810	tion. By ignoring DNA sequence differences,
811	these methods might incorrectly predict sub-
812	stitutions at sites under positive selection to
813	be neutral because of the many amino acids
814	present at that position. However, the AAS
815	prediction method of Fleming et al. (19) uses
816	the DNA sequences of homologous genes in
817	addition to protein sequences to ﬁnd sites un-
818	der positive selection. The nonsynonymous-
819	to-synonymous substitution rate ratio is al-
820	lowed to vary at different amino acid sites and
821	positions with high ratios are posited to be un-
822	der positive selection. It is assumed that amino
823	acid changes at these positions affect pro-
824	tein function. Thus, knowledge of positively
825	selected sites can lower the false negative
826	error.
827	Users should be cautious even with pro-
828	teins that are judged to be orthologous based
829	on phylogeny. Orthologous genes in differ-
830	ent species are derived from a common an-
831	cestor, but they may not necessarily have the
832	same function. If function has changed, then
833	amino acids that are important for the func-
834	tion of one protein may not necessarily be
835	important for the function of the ortholog,
836	and hence may have changed without any se-
837	lection pressure. For example, 2% of disease-
838	causing mutations in human genes are identi-
839	cal to the sequences of their respective mouse
840	orthologs, suggesting that even though these
841	positions have huge phenotypic effects on
842	human health, they have different roles or
843	are no longer important in mice. If the or-
844	thologs in alignment have slightly different

851	vation that single AASs can have a large effect

853	terest to identify which nsSNPs affect protein

856	mutation reduces protein function. But in
857	some instances, the amino acid correspond-
858	ing to the more common allele reduces pro-
859	tein function and a mutation causes gain-of-
860	function. Thomas et al. (73) noticed this phe-
861	nomenon when they applied their AAS pre-
862	diction method PANTHER PSEC to mu-
863	tations likely to cause disease. They found
864	that the reference amino acid was predicted
865	to damage protein function whereas the dis-
866	ease mutation was predicted to be function-
867	ally neutral for a small percentage of the
868	cases (0.1%). This type of prediction re-
869	veals two things. First, it suggests that the
870	human protein sequence has reduced func-
871	tion compared with orthologous proteins in
872	other organisms. Second, it predicts that
873	the “disease” mutation returns protein func-
874	tion to a level similar to that in ortholo-
875	gous proteins. Thus the mutation can be
876	thought to have a gain-of-function effect
877	in humans. Characterizing this mutation in
878	model organisms may be inappropriate be-
879	cause the common human allele has reduced
880	protein activity compared with that in model
881	organisms.
882	nsSNPs in the human population are ob-
883	served less frequently than expected from the
884	overall mutation rate, which is evidence that
885	they are under strong purifying selection (8,
886	23, 63). Speciﬁcally, if a random mutation
887	were to occur in a coding region, it should
888	lead to an amino acid change two thirds of the
889	time, but nsSNPs comprise only half of the
890	observed coding SNPs in the human genome
891	(8). Furthermore, nsSNPs that cause a non-
892	conservative amino acid change in the corre-
893	sponding protein (for example, hydrophobic
894	amino acid to a charged amino acid) survive
895	at approximately half the rate of conservative
896	nsSNPs (for example, a hydrophobic amino
897	acid changed to another hydrophobic amino
898	acid). These data strongly support the notion
899	that AASs play an important role in human
900	health. By providing information about which
901	substitutions are selected against, AAS predic-
902	tion methods can help identify which nsSNPs
903	may be involved in disease.
904	Both structure and sequence are useful for
905	prediction. Having a structure appears to pro-
906	vide prediction performance that is equiva-
907	lent to having four homologous sequences,
908	with information from structure and sequence
909	complementing each other (59). Finally, it is
910	important to understand that these are pre-
911	dictions only. They are meant to guide future
912	experiments and not to be used directly in a
913	clinical setting (71).
914	Putative nsSNPs are catalogued in the
915	dbSNP database maintained by NCBI, which
916	currently contains >50,000 nsSNPs (dbSNP
917	build 124) (60). Of these nsSNPs, 25–30% are
918	predicted to reduce protein function by most
919	AAS prediction methods (46, 69, 83). Such
920	nsSNPs have a lower minor allele frequency
921	distribution than those that are predicted to
922	be functionally neutral (33–35, 69, 78). This
923	suggests that damaging nsSNPs are being ac-
924	tively selected against and conﬁrms that AAS
925	prediction methods can successfully identify
926	putatively damaging nsSNPs that play an
927	important role in health. In one study, the
928	AAS prediction method SIFT was applied to
929	nsSNPs found in genes implicated in DNA
930	repair, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and detox-
931	iﬁcation (78). nsSNPs with low minor allele
932	frequency (<6%) were predicted by SIFT to
933	be damaging to the protein twice as often as

945	In summary, AAS prediction methods
946	have proven useful for identifying damaging
947	nsSNPs involved in human disease. Experi-
948	mentally characterizing an AAS can be expen-
949	sive and time-consuming, and AAS prediction
950	methods provide a valuable resource to sub-
951	stantially reduce the effort.
952	Application to Mendelian Disease
953	common nsSNPs (>10%). In a second study,
954	less than 2% of common nsSNPs in en-
955	vironmental response genes were predicted
956	to be damaging by AAS prediction meth-
957	ods PolyPhen and SIFT (34, 35). In a third
958	study, SIFT was applied to nsSNPs found
959	in membrane transporter genes (34). Of the
960	nsSNPs with minor allele frequency <0.01,
961	between 0.01 and 0.10, and >0.1, 40%, 13%,
962	and 5% of nsSNPs were predicted to be
963	damaging, respectively. The authors found
964	that general-purpose AAS scoring matrices,
965	such as BLOSUM62, could not distinguish
966	nsSNPs by minor allele frequency. Thus, ap-
967	plication of AAS prediction methods to large
968	nsSNP data sets has conﬁrmed that putatively
969	damaging nsSNPs are selected against and are
970	likely to have an impact on their respective
971	proteins.
972	AAS prediction methods have succeeded in
973	distinguishing nonsynonymous changes that
974	cause simple Mendelian diseases from neutral
975	nsSNPs that do not. AAS prediction meth-
976	ods are trained and tested on AASs that were
977	identiﬁed in disease genes in afﬂicted indi-
978	viduals from databases such as OMIM (24),
979	HGMD (62), and Swiss-Prot (1). It is assumed
980	that these substitutions found in patients af-
981	fect protein function and cause disease as a
982	result. Currently, most of the diseases repre-
983	sented by the genes in these databases segre-
984	gate in a Mendelian manner, which suggests
985	that they are caused by single deleterious le-
986	sions. Most AAS prediction methods predict
987	that 70–90% of the AASs catalogued in these
988	disease databases are damaging, whereas only
989	10–20% of variants in neutral data sets are
990	predicted to be damaging (Table 1). This
991	demonstrates that AAS prediction methods
992	can distinguish between AASs that cause
993	Mendelian disease and neutral AASs. In
994	this way, AAS prediction methods can help
995	narrow down candidate nsSNPs to iden-
996	tify the causative lesion within a large ge-
997	nomic region implicated in disease by linkage
998	studies.
999	Experimental studies of individual pro-
1000	teins have also conﬁrmed the accuracy of AAS
1001	prediction methods. In one study, Brooks-
1002	Wilson et al. (6) studied mutations in E-
1003	cadherin that cause hereditary diffuse gastric
1004	cancer. They used SIFT to predict that three
1005	missense mutations found in families with dif-
1006	fuse gastric cancer would be damaging to E-
1007	cadherin function, and all three were con-
1008	ﬁrmed to be damaging using in vitro assays.
1009	In a second study, Zhang et al. (84) examined
1010	the variants in PEPT1, a protein involved in
1011	transporting drugs across the cell membrane.
1012	nsSNPs found in the gene for PEPT1 were
1013	tested in vitro. The single SNP that reduced
1014	transport capacity was predicted by SIFT to
1015	affect protein function. This polymorphism
1016	may be important in drug delivery for phar-
1017	macogenetics. In a third study, SIFT was used
1018	to predict categories of cancer risk. Mutations
1019	in the gene encoding melanocyte stimulating
1020	hormone receptor (MSHR) increase the risk
1021	of skin cancer. Kanetsky et al. (30) identiﬁed
1022	risk variants in the gene for MSHR from ei-
1023	ther published literature or using SIFT pre-
1024	dictions. The ability to assign an individual to
1025	a risk category was found to be similar when
1026	using either published literature or SIFT
1027	prediction.
1028	Although most simple Mendelian diseases
1029	remain rare because of purifying selection,
1030	some become relatively common in popu-
1031	lations because of overdominant selection.
1032	Overdominant selection occurs when the het-
1033	eroyzgote carrier has higher ﬁtness than
1034	both the mutant and normal homozygotes.

1043	Common disease-common variant. Ac-
1044	whereas individuals homozygous for the rare
1045	allele have sickle-cell anemia. In this example,
1046	the AAS affects protein function but is main-
1047	tained in the population because reduced ac-
1048	tivity correlates with an advantageous effect.
1049	Another well-known example is overdomi-
1050	nance associated with methylenetetrahydro-
1051	folate reductase (MTHFR) alleles. Variants
1052	that reduce MTHFR activity can cause mental
1053	retardation and cardiovascular disease in car-
1054	riers. Reduced MTHFR activity is thought to
1055	have been beneﬁcial to an individual’s over-
1056	all ﬁtness during recent human evolution,
1057	so MTHFR variants damaging to protein
1058	function have became common in human
1059	populations. Because overdominant nsSNPs
1060	can severely affect protein function, they may
1061	be detected by AAS prediction methods, and
1062	both E6V in β-globin and overdominant
1063	MTHFR missense alleles are predicted to be
1064	damaging by SIFT (Reference 46 and data not
1065	shown).
1066	cording to the common disease-common vari-
1067	ant hypothesis, variants that are common in
1068	the population, with minor allele frequency
1069	greater than 5% or 1%, contribute to disease.
1070	If nsSNPs involved in complex disease can be
1071	categorized according to the rules of struc-
1072	ture and sequence conservation that AAS pre-
1073	diction methods have been trained on, then
1074	current AAS prediction methods will be use-
1075	ful in identifying these common etiological
1076	variants. A list of common nsSNPs that have
1077	been associated with complex disease has been
1078	compiled (28, 37). When the AAS prediction
1079	method PANTHER PSEC was applied to
1080	this set of disease-causing nsSNPs, the score
1081	distribution was different from the distribu-
1082	tion for Mendelian disease mutations (74).
1083	More importantly, the score distribution of
1084	these disease-associated nsSNPs is indistin-
1085	guishable from the distribution for normal
1086	human variation (Figure 4). The authors con-
1087	clude that nsSNPs involved in complex dis-
1088	eases caused by common variants do not occur
1089	at highly conserved positions, and thus cannot
1090	be detected by current AAS prediction meth-
1091	ods. The data set of nsSNPs known to be in-
1092	volved in common disease is relatively small
1093	compared with the set of mutations known
1094	to be involved in Mendelian disease. As more
1095	causative common variants implicated in com-
1096	plex disease are discovered, it will be interest-
1097	ing to see if future studies yield similar results.
1098	If so, new rules will need to be formulated to
1099	predict the common polymorphisms involved
1100	in complex disease.
1101	Application to Complex Diseases
1102	Although AAS prediction methods can iden-
1103	tify nsSNPs involved in Mendelian diseases,
1104	their usefulness in studying complex diseases,
1105	such as hypertension, diabetes, and heart dis-
1106	ease, is still being explored. Complex genetic
1107	diseases are those that cannot be mapped to
1108	single loci, which might indicate an interac-
1109	tion between multiple loci or an interaction
1110	with the environment, or both. Two general
1111	models have been proposed to explain the na-
1112	ture of genetic variation underlying complex
1113	disease (4, 51, 52, 85). The common disease-
1114	common variant model predicts that the vari-
1115	ants of a particular locus that contribute to
1116	disease are few but common in the popula-
1117	tion and that complex disease results from
1118	interactions between variants of many differ-
1119	ent genes. The common disease-rare variant
1120	model predicts that there are many etiological
1121	variants at a locus, and each variant is present
1122	at a low allele frequency in the human popu-
1123	lation. In this section, we discuss how useful
1124	AAS prediction methods might be for detect-
1125	AAS prediction methods can still be useful
1126	in identifying the etiological variants in hap-
1127	lotypes. Haplotypes are particular combina-
1128	tions of alleles that are observed in a popu-
1129	lation. When a haplotype is associated with
1130	affected individuals, the variants belonging to
1131	the haplotype are all candidates for being the
1132	causative mutation. If a haplotype contains
1133	a set of missense alleles, one can use AAS

1166	A study on the plasma levels of HDL
1167	cholesterol (HDL-C) demonstrates the use of
1168	AAS prediction methods to detect rare dele-
1169	terious alleles that contribute to common dis-
1170	ease (10). Low levels of HDL-C are a ma-
1171	jor risk factor for coronary atherosclerosis.
1172	Three candidate genes involved in Mendelian
1173	forms of low HDL-C levels were sequenced
1174	in apparently normal individuals and a larger
1175	number of rare nsSNPs were found in peo-
1176	ple with low levels of HDL-C compared with
1177	those with high levels of HDL-C. The au-
1178	thors then applied the AAS prediction method
1179	PolyPhen on the nsSNPs. The fraction of
1180	nsSNPs predicted to be damaging in individ-
1181	uals with low levels of HDL-C is highly sig-
1182	niﬁcant for two of the genes: p=9×10 −13 for
1183	ABCA1 and p= 0.0003 for LCAT (Table 2).
1184	In the third gene, APOA1, only one nsSNP
1185	was detected, and although it was predicted to
1186	be damaging, this is not statistically signiﬁcant
1187	(p = 0.09). If technological advances permit us
1188	to inexpensively sequence the coding regions
1189	of many individuals, one could possibly iden-
1190	tify the genes and variants involved in disease
1191	by the increased number of nsSNPs and the
1192	signiﬁcantly high proportion of nsSNPs pre-
1193	dicted to be damaging in the affected pop-
1194	ulation. Even with a Bonferroni correction
1195	taking into account the approximately 30,000
1196	genes in the human genome, the result of
1197	ABCA1 is still signiﬁcant atp=10 −8 . The re-
1198	sult of LCAT is no longer signiﬁcant at the
1199	genome-wide level. This could be compen-
1200	sated for by detecting more variants, which re-
1201	quires sequencing, or improved performance
1202	of AAS prediction methods to reduce the false
1203	positive error.
1204	Amino acid substitution (AAS) prediction methods may not be able to
1205	identify disease variants in the common disease/common variant model.
1206	Cumulative distributions of scores from the AAS prediction method
1207	PANTHER subPSEC are shown. A subPSEC score of 0 is predicted to be

1215	nsSNP may be the etiological variant (84).
1216	Common disease-rare variant. According
1217	to the common disease/rare variant hypothe-
1218	sis, low-frequency variants with strong effects
1219	on a locus can contribute to disease (52). That
1220	is, some “complex” diseases could actually
1221	be simple Mendelian diseases, but are caused
1222	by different allelic variants in different indi-
1223	viduals. Identifying these rare causative vari-
1224	ants requires sequencing genes in many indi-
1225	viduals. This process would uncover a large
1226	number of missense variants but only a few
1227	may contribute to disease. Below we discuss

1276	OTHER APPLICATIONS OF AAS
1277	PREDICTION METHODS
1278	Interspecies Comparisons
1279	AAS prediction methods are often applied to
1280	polymorphisms within a species, but they can
1281	also be used on the ﬁxed substitutions across
1282	species. Because AAS prediction methods pre-
1283	dict which amino acids are damaging to pro-
1284	tein function, they can identify which genes
1285	are under relaxed or neutral selection in a par-
1286	ticular species.
1287	distinguish patients from controls with 100%
1288	accuracy and two genes were identiﬁed to
1289	have more putative damaging missense vari-
1290	ants compared with controls. In this case, all
1291	genes had a similar proportion of missense
1292	variants. Only by applying their AAS predic-
1293	tion method were the authors able to identify
1294	two genes that may be involved in Parkinson’s
1295	disease. Because mutations in mitochondrial
1296	DNA become more abundant with increasing
1297	age, the role of rare missense variants may play
1298	an important role in late-onset diseases such
1299	as Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease.
1300	Because there already exists technology for
1301	resequencing mitochondrial genomes (38),
1302	one may be able to study the common dis-
1303	ease/rare variant model in diseases suspected
1304	to involve the mitochondria.
1305	Interspecies comparisons show that do-
1306	mesticated species have a higher number
1307	of putative damaging SNPs than the wild
1308	species. The Chicken Polymorphism Con-
1309	sortium sequenced three domestic breeds of
1310	chicken and compared these data to those
1311	obtained from a wild line (79). For the non-
1312	synonymous substitutions ﬁxed between the
1313	domestic and wild lines, the alleles found
1314	in domestic breeds were more than twice as
1315	likely to be predicted as damaging by the
1316	AAS prediction method SIFT compared with
1317	those in the wild line. This result suggests that
1318	domestic breeds are under relaxed selection,
1319	perhaps because they live in a less harsh en-
1320	vironment, which has allowed for damag-
1321	ing substitutions to become ﬁxed in the do-
1322	mesticated species. In another interspecies
1323	If common diseases cannot be explained by
1324	common variants, then there will be a strong
1325	incentive to sequence coding regions to test
1326	the common disease/rare variant hypothesis.
1327	Preliminary studies show that AAS prediction
1328	methods play an important role in predict-
1329	ing which rare missense variants are delete-
1330	rious. Moreover, as technologies for discov-
1331	ering rare variants advance, AAS prediction
1332	methods will become increasingly important
1333	for identifying disease genes in genome-wide
1334	studies.

1337	CONCLUSIONS
1338	The presence of many AAS prediction meth-
1339	ods and their broad use underscores their im-
1340	portance. Prediction accuracy has gradually
1341	improved, but few head-to-head comparisons
1342	exist (29, 35, 71, 81). Moreover, as the number
1343	of servers providing AAS prediction increases,
1344	it will become increasingly difﬁcult for inves-
1345	tigators to interpret the predictions.
1346	comparison, the missense substitutions be-
1347	tween two species of domesticated rice were
1348	studied and a higher density of predicted dam-
1349	aging substitutions occurred in regions un-
1350	der positive selection (G.S.K. Wong, per-
1351	sonal communication). Because gene loss may
1352	sometimes be adaptive (48), the result sug-
1353	gested reduced function of some genes in rice
1354	could be an adaptive response to domestica-
1355	tion.
1356	These problems are similar to those faced
1357	by the protein structure prediction commu-
1358	nity 10 years ago. Critical Assessment of
1359	Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction
1360	(CASP) (43) was motivated by the need to
1361	fairly assess structure prediction programs in
1362	order to advance structure prediction meth-
1363	ods; we propose a similar solution for AAS
1364	prediction methods.
1365	These studies suggest that AAS pre-
1366	diction methods can provide insights into
1367	phenotypic differences observed between
1368	species. Because of false positive error, it
1369	would be difﬁcult to study this on an in-
1370	dividual gene basis. However, by grouping
1371	genes within protein families or pathways,
1372	it may be possible to identify pathways that
1373	have undergone relaxed selection in certain
1374	species.
1375	Large-Scale Mutagenesis
1376	Every two years, CASP releases the
1377	sequences of proteins for which structure is
1378	known, but not yet available to the public.
1379	Researchers return predictions which are
1380	then compared with known structure, and
1381	the efﬁcacy of each prediction method is
1382	assessed. Because investigators in the CASP
1383	program work on the same proteins during a
1384	speciﬁed period of time, the CASP program
1385	offers a valuable way to summarize which
1386	methods improve structure prediction and
1387	this ultimately advances the ﬁeld. As auto-
1388	mated structure prediction methods have
1389	become increasingly successful, there is now a
1390	server competition that runs continuously as
1391	structures are released, with results assessed
1392	automatically (57).
1393	AAS prediction methods can be applied to
1394	large-scale, reverse genetics projects, in which
1395	mutations are introduced randomly in the
1396	genome of an experimental organism, and to
1397	random mutagenesis projects, when a gene
1398	of interest is saturated with mutations (4, 22,
1399	26, 36, 49, 51, 52, 54, 80, 85). When there
1400	are many missense mutations in the gene(s)
1401	of interest, assaying all missense mutations
1402	can be expensive and time-consuming. AAS
1403	prediction methods can be used to priori-
1404	tize missense mutations that are most likely
1405	to affect protein function and alter pheno-
1406	type. TILLING is one example of a large-
1407	scale reverse genetic strategy that uses an AAS
1408	prediction method (SIFT) to prioritize which
1409	missense mutations are likely to reveal a phe-
1410	notype (26). TILLING has been applied to
1411	a wide range of organisms: Arabidopsis, ze-
1412	braﬁsh, maize, Drosophila, and Lotus. Because
1413	AAS prediction methods are automated and
1414	general, they can be widely applied to help
1415	researchers prioritize which AAS to charac-
1416	terize in genes of interest.
1417	A similar server competition could be
1418	implemented for AAS prediction. Once a
1419	disease-associated variant is mapped, the re-
1420	sponsible nsSNP and benign control nsSNPs
1421	could be sent to participating servers and
1422	the results immediately evaluated. Obtain-
1423	ing suitable data sets is difﬁcult because each
1424	data set has its own advantages and disadvan-
1425	tages. For example, some of the AASs ob-
1426	tained from patients in the OMIM database
1427	may not necessarily be the causative vari-
1428	ant, which will artifactually inﬂate the false

1431	function, affects structure, or which domain
1432	or function is affected for multifunctional
1433	enzymes.
1434	negative error. But if one method has a higher
1435	accuracy on both neutral and damaging data
1436	sets, then, despite the inaccuracies of the test
1437	sets, the prediction method can be assessed
1438	to be better. Moreover, as genome-wide mu-
1439	tagenesis projects generate phenotypic data
1440	(26), more accurate data can be obtained and
1441	tested.
1442	Finally, the main beneﬁt of such a com-
1443	petition is that investigators would have ac-
1444	cess to uniﬁed prediction. Currently, CASP
1445	manages a metaserver that collects predictions
1446	from other servers to obtain a consensus struc-
1447	ture. A metaserver for AAS prediction could
1448	do the same, so that researchers studying pro-
1449	tein variation could easily obtain a consensus
1450	prediction, with the best accuracy available.
1451	In addition to accuracy, AAS prediction
1452	methods can be evaluated based on coverage.
1453	Coverage depends on the source and version
1454	of structure and sequence databases used. The
1455	number of sequences and structures increase
1456	every year so coverage is expected to increase
1457	simply because more information is available.
1458	The progress that has been made over the
1459	past few years with AAS prediction meth-
1460	ods is promising: methodology has improved
1461	and applications have proliferated. AAS pre-
1462	diction methods have proven successful for
1463	Mendelian traits and may eventually play an
1464	important role in identifying complex disease
1465	variants. Because AASs are a source of funda-
1466	mental changes between and within species,
1467	AAS prediction methods will continue to be of
1468	major importance in the future. These meth-
1469	ods, in conjunction with those that predict
1470	gene regulatory and splicing variants (12, 13,
1471	15, 20, 66, 76), will guide us to a better under-
1472	standing of functional diversity in genomes.
1473	Most methods today offer conﬁdence
1474	scores or an estimate of the degree to which
1475	a substitution is damaging. One could also
1476	test how well an AAS prediction method’s
1477	score correlates with phenotypic severity; the
1478	MAPP method and the method by Mooney
1479	et al. (42, 67) have already demonstrated
1480	promising results as their scores correlate with
1481	phenotypic severity. AAS prediction meth-
1482	ods could also be assessed according to their
1483	ability to predict how the substitution affects
1484	the protein: whether it increases or decreases
1485	SUMMARY POINTS
1486	1. Approximately half of the known disease-causing mutations result from amino acid
1487	substitutions (AASs).
1488	2. AAS prediction methods can successfully distinguish between AASs that cause
1489	Mendelian disease and functionally neutral AASs.
1490	3. Automated AAS prediction methods have been applied on a genome-wide scale.
1491	4. Nonsynonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) predicted to be damaging tend to have low minor
1492	allele frequencies, which indicates purifying selection and validates AAS prediction
1493	methods.
1494	5. AAS prediction methods have been applied to individual genes and predictions have
1495	been experimentally conﬁrmed.
1496	6. Currently, AAS prediction methods cannot distinguish between common variants
1497	involved in common disease and normal variation.
1498	7. AAS prediction methods can identify rare variants involved in common disease. When
1499	putative damaging rare variants are classiﬁed by gene, disease genes can be identiﬁed.

1501	ANRV285-GG07-03 ARI 8 August 2006 1:43
1502	8. AAS prediction methods can be used on a wide range of problems, such as analysis of
1503	interspecies differences and large-scale mutagenesis projects.
1504	FUTURE DIRECTIONS
1505	1. Because there are many new and improved amino acid substitution (AAS) predic-
1506	tion methods with complementary strengths, better accuracy should be possible by
1507	combining prediction methods. A competition similar to the Critical Assessment of
1508	Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) would help to evaluate progress
1509	and identify strengths and weaknesses of prediction algorithms.
1510	2. While the genetics community is actively engaged in discovering genetic variants
1511	involved in complex disease, AAS prediction methods will need to be continually
1512	reassessed and possibly redesigned for optimal prediction of complex disease-causing
1513	variants.
1514	3. Although AASs currently account for a large proportion of the genetic variation con-
1515	tributing to human disease, new bioinformatics methods that evaluate gene regulatory
1516	and splicing variants will broaden our understanding of functional variation.
