18	Core Symptoms of Depression

21	validation by Western blot analysis confirmed
22	that bCaMKII in the membrane fraction of cLH
23	habenular protein samples increased to 1.86 times
24	those of the controls (P = 0.03) (Fig. 1D). In con-
25	trast, the bCaMKII protein level in cLH hippo-
26	campal samples decreased (63% of control, P=
27	0.048) (Fig. 1E), probably because of neural atrophy
28	and spine loss in the hippocampus associated with
29	depression (21, 22). bCaMKII mRNA in cLH ha-
30	benula increased to 1.37 times the amount in controls
31	(P = 0.04), as measured by quantitative real-time
32	PCR (QPCR) (Fig. 1F), which suggested that tran-
33	scriptional regulation contributed to at least part
34	of the change in the amount of protein. Immu-
35	nohistochemical staining of habenular brain slices
36	revealed that the CaMKII protein increased in the
37	lateral part of the habenula (LHb) (fig. S5).
38	The lateral habenula (LHb) has recently emerged as a key brain region in the pathophysiology of
39	depression. However, the molecular mechanism by which LHb becomes hyperactive in depression
40	remains unknown. Through a quantitative proteomic screen, we found that expression of the b form of
41	calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II (bCaMKII) was significantly up-regulated in
42	the LHb of animal models of depression and down-regulated by antidepressants. Increasing b-, but
43	not a-, CaMKII in the LHb strongly enhanced the synaptic efficacy and spike output of LHb neurons
44	and was sufficient to produce profound depressive symptoms, including anhedonia and behavioral
45	despair. Down-regulation of bCaMKII levels, blocking its activity or its target molecule the glutamate
46	receptor GluR1 reversed the depressive symptoms. These results identify bCaMKII as a powerful
47	regulator of LHb neuron function and a key molecular determinant of depression.
48	ajor depressive disorder (MDD), one
49	nisms underlie these aberrant cellular processes
50	in LHb and how depression-inducing stimuli lead
51	to these changes are yet to be determined.
52	of the most prevalent and disabling men-
53	M
54	We further examined bCaMKII in two ad-
55	ditional depression models, acute learned help-
56	lessness, induced by repeated inescapable and
57	uncontrollable foot shocks (16), and chronic mild
58	stress, induced by prolonged exposure to unpre-
59	dictable mild stressors (23). The amounts of
60	bCaMKII were also significantly increased in
61	these two stress paradigms (Fig. 1G). Further-
62	more, chronic antidepressant treatment with imip-
63	ramine, which reversed the depressive phenotypes
64	of cLH rats (Fig. 1A), caused significant down-
65	regulation of bCaMKII protein in the habenula of
66	cLH rats (Fig. 1H).
67	We conducted an unbiased, mass spectrometry–
68	based, quantitative proteomic screening to com-
69	pare habenular protein expression of wild-type
70	controls with that of congenitally learned helpless
71	(cLH) rats, a well-accepted model of depression
72	(15). cLH rats were selectively bred for the phe-
73	notype of learned helplessness (16). They dis-
74	played significantly reduced lever pressing to
75	escape foot shocks, which was reversed by chronic
76	antidepressant treatment (imipramine, injected in-
77	traperitoneally 10 mg per kg of body weight, for
78	14 days) (Fig. 1A). cLH rats also showed in-
79	creased (longer) immobility in the forced swim
80	test (Fig. 1A), another animal model of de-
81	pression that reflects behavioral despair (17), al-
82	though basic motor and cognitive functions are
83	normal (15).
84	tal disorders, is characterized by low
85	mood, loss of motivation, feelings of despair, and
86	an inability to feel pleasure, also known as an-
87	hedonia (1). Modern views on the cause of MDD
88	suggest that the neural activities of specific brain
89	circuits are altered in response to external stimuli,
90	such as stress, as a result of maladaptive mo-
91	lecular and cellular changes (2, 3). Recently, the
92	lateral habenula (LHb), a nucleus that relays in-
93	formation from the limbic forebrain to multiple
94	monoamine centers, has emerged as a key brain
95	region in aversive behaviors and the pathophys-
96	iology of depression (4–10). LHb neurons are
97	activated by aversive emotional cues, including
98	stress, disappointment, fear, or anticipation of a
99	negative reward (4–6). Consistently, neuroimag-
100	ing studies have identified heightened habenula
101	activity in the depressed state (11–13). Further-
102	more, synaptic activity and spike output of LHb
103	neurons were enhanced in animal models of de-
104	pression (14). However, what molecular mecha-
105	We next investigated to what extent the change
106	in bCaMKII in LHb is necessary or sufficient to
107	cause depressive behaviors or whether it is merely
108	a biological marker of the depressive state. We
109	first constructed viral vectors [adeno-associated
110	virus 2 (AAV2)] to overexpress b- or aCaMKII in
111	the LHb of wild-type rats and mice and tested the
112	effects on various depression models (Fig. 2, A to
113	C). We used the ubiquitin promoter to drive ubiq-
114	uitous, high-level gene expression, as LHb neu-
115	rons are almost uniformly glutamatergic (24). To
116	estimate the level of overexpression, we injected
117	CaMKII-expressing viruses into one side of the
118	habenula. Fourteen days after injection, CaMKII
119	levels in the injected side were 4.4 (T 0.6)–fold
120	for bCaMKII and 4.6 (T 0.9)–fold for aCaMKII
121	of the noninjected side, respectively (fig. S6).
122	We then injected virus into both sides of LHb
123	and allowed expression for 10 days before behav-
124	ioral testing of depression (Fig. 2, B and C, and
125	fig. S7).

136	We microdissected the habenuli of cLH and
137	wild-type control rats and extracted protein for
138	quantitative proteomic analysis based on 15 N sta-
139	ble isotope labeling (Fig. 1B) (18). To reduce
140	sample complexity, we extracted the membrane
141	fraction and analyzed three independent sets of
142	samples (figs. S1 to S3 and table S1). The b form
143	of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase
144	type II (bCaMKII) was significantly up-regulated
145	in the habenula of cLH rats (1.9 times the bCaMKII
146	of wild-type control, P= 0.01) (Fig. 1C). Other
147	CaMKII family isoforms were also examined:
148	aCaMKII levels varied widely across samples, al-
149	though an increasing trend was observed; dCaMKII
150	remained unchanged; and gCaMKII showed a
151	1.3-fold increase (P = 0.0013) (fig. S4). As bCaMKII
152	is more enriched in the brain than gCaMKII (19, 20),
153	we focused on this CaMKII isoform. Secondary
154	Overexpression of bCaMKII in the LHb of
155	unstressed mice produced significantly increased
156	immobility time and decreased latency to immo-
157	bility onset in the forced swim test, compared with
158	the injected control (Fig. 2D). Locomotor activ-
159	ities of these mice were not significantly differ-
160	ent (fig. S8), which indicated that the immobility

530	and no change in mEPSC amplitude (87 T 5% of

538	infected neurons increased 3.0-fold compared
539	with neighboring uninfected neurons (P = 0.0004)
540	was not likely due to motor defects. In addition,
541	bCaMKII overexpression also caused anhedonia,
542	evident from a significant reduction in the pref-
543	erence for the sucrose solution (Fig. 2E). To es-
544	timate the minimal infection rate required to
545	produce the depression phenotype, we bilater-
546	ally injected an additional group of mice with
547	1:10 diluted AAV-bCaMKII virus. Unlike the nor-
548	mal injection group (having an infection rate of
549	38 T 3%), this sparse injection group (having
550	an infection rate of 5T 0.6%) did not exhibit
551	depressive-like phenotypes (fig. S9). Overexpres-
552	sion of aCaMKII, or a control green fluorescent
553	protein (GFP)-Cre construct, at a similar infection
554	rate (36 T 2.5% for aCaMKII, 36 T 3% for GFP-
555	Cre) did not cause similar depressive-like effects
556	(Fig. 2, D and E). bCaMKII can act both as a
557	kinase and a structural scaffolding protein at the
558	synapses (25). A kinase-dead version of bCaMKII

797	and E). The percentage of learned helpless animals
798	(defined as those that pressed the bar less than five
799	times) dropped from 83.3 to 25% (Fig. 4F).

801	detected for AAV-aCaMKII–infected (P = 0.7)

803	(Fig. 3H).
804	of LHb neurons is sufficient to ameliorate depres-
805	sion. Thus, we further analyzed infection within
806	subregions of LHb, and found that infection rates
807	in the medial, but not lateral, part of LHb were
808	strongly correlated with the rescuing effects on
809	learned helplessness (Fig. 4G). In the LHb brain
810	slices of cLH rats, neurons infected by the AAV-
811	bRNAi showed significantly reduced frequency of
812	mEPSCs (53.5 T 15.3% of neighboring uninfected
813	controls, P= 0.008) (Fig. 4H).
814	To rule out potential off-target effects by RNAi,
815	we tested a kinase-dead version of bCaMKII,
816	bK43R, which acts as a dominant-negative pro-
817	tein to block endogenous bCaMKII function when
818	overexpressed (26) (Fig. 2A). When we injected
819	AAV-bK43R virus into the LHb of cLH rats, we
820	observed antidepressive effects similar to those
821	seen with AAV-bRNAi in both the forced swim
822	and learned helplessness tests (Fig. 4, D to F). It
823	was noteworthy that an infection rate as low as
824	17 T 3% for AAV-bRNAi or 24 T 3% for AAV-
825	bK43R was sufficient to achieve these strong anti-
826	depressive effects, which suggested that the LHb
827	neural network has little redundancy and that al-

829	To determine whether down-regulation of
830	bCaMKII or blockade of bCaMKII functions in
831	LHb reversed depressive phenotypes, we first used
832	RNA interference (RNAi) to reduce (knock down)
833	the amount of bCaMKII protein (Fig. 4A). A pre-
834	viously reported short hairpin RNA specifically tar-
835	geting the bCaMKII transcript can effectively
836	reduce bCaMKII protein without affecting aCaMKII
837	(28) (Fig. 4B). We then expressed this RNAi form
838	of bCaMKII in AAV virus (AAV-bRNAi) and tar-
839	geted its expression to the LHb of cLH rats by
840	bilateral stereotactic injection (Fig. 4C). In cLH

954	In the context of our finding that the medial
955	part of the LHb (LHb-M) is critical for the rescue
956	of learned helplessness behavior (Fig. 4G), it is
957	relevant to note that stress-induced c-Fos activa-
958	tion is relatively confined to the LHb-M (4) and
959	that there were more neurons with higher mEPSC
960	frequency in LHb-M than those in LHb-L (fig.
961	S10A). Further, LHb-M and LHb-L have different
962	circuit wiring, which could contribute to their
963	differential involvement in aversive behaviors and
964	depressive symptoms (fig. S12B). Molecular ma-
965	nipulations in the nucleus accumbens (NAc)
966	specifically mediate anhedonia but not behavioral
967	despair (39). We found manipulation of bCaMΚΙΙ
968	levels in the LHb affected both of these symptoms,
969	which suggests that LHb may function upstream
970	of NAc in the depression-related circuitry to con-
971	trol multiple aspects of depressive symptoms.
972	Hence, the molecular targets identified in the
973	LHb in this study should provide new insights for
974	therapies that treat both of these core symptoms
975	of depression.

990	References and Notes
991	Here, we identified bCaMΚΙΙ as a key mo-
992	lecular determinant of habenular hyperactivity
993	and behavioral depression, using a combination of
994	molecular, behavioral, and electrophysiological
995	approaches. Our results point to a model in which
996	stress-induced up-regulation of bCaMΚΙΙ in the
997	LHb causes more GluR1 insertion into synapses,
998	resulting in increased synaptic efficacy. In ad-
999	dition, bCaMΚΙΙ may regulate other channels
1000	and membrane properties of LHb neurons to en-
1001	hance spike output, all of which work in concert
1002	to cause LHb hyperactivity and lead to enhanced
1003	suppression of downstream monoamine centers
1004	(fig. S12A). Previous studies have implicated
1005	changes in CaMKIIs related to stress and anti-
1006	depressant response (32–35). However, it was un-
1007	clear whether these changes are necessary or
1008	sufficient for depression etiology, and which brain
1009	region or isoform is crucial (36). bCaMKII is about
1010	eight times as sensitive to calcium/calmodulin as
1011	aCaMKII (37) and has an actin-binding motif
1012	that is absent in aCaMKII (38). It will be inter-
1013	esting to pinpoint in the future which feature of
1014	bCaMΚΙΙ renders this isoform-specific function
1015	in depression.

1062	An important future question is how depressive
1063	stimuli and antidepressants lead to bidirectional
1064	changes in bCaMΚΙΙ levels in the LHb. Aversive
1065	emotional stimuli activate LHb neurons (4–6), where-
1066	as serotonin boosted by antidepressants suppresses
1067	excitatory inputs onto the LHb (7). Thus, it is tempt-
1068	ing to speculate that bCaMΚΙΙ levels are regulated
1069	by LHb neural activity. During the onset of depres-
1070	sion, prolonged activation of LHb neurons may
1071	cause the up-regulation of bCaMΚΙΙ to reach a
1072	threshold level, which can lead to further LHb neural
1073	activation. Conversely, antidepressant-caused sup-
